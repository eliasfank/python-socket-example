# python-socket-example
A small example of how to send a file using socket in python.

### description
There is a client who wants to know the total sum of a list of products(similar to a invoice). So, he creates a txt file putting into it the product name, the number of units of each product and the price per unit. After this, he can send that file to the server that calculates the total sum of the price for all products and sends back to the client the result value. Making it clear that the goal of this task is the use of sockets, and not the busines process.
